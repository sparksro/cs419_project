Email sending tool will send a text based test advising registration email or a cancellation email depending on users menu choice.  It is currently set up to work with Gmail but it might work with other mail services.  The sending email service settings need to be hard coded. If the simulated advisees name needs to be changed it will need to be hard coded as well.
